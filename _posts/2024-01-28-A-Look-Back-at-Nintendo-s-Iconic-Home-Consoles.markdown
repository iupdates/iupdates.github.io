### Reviving the Video Game Industry

Nintendo launched the NES in the mid-1980s, helping to revitalize the video game industry after the 1983 crash. The NES was a major commercial success and introduced beloved franchises like Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda. These games helped establish Nintendo as the leader in home console gaming. The simplicity of the NES games appealed to both children and adults.

### Defining the 16-Bit Era 

Released in 1990, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System built on the success of the NES. Games like Super Mario World and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past took advantage of the SNES's improved graphics and sound. These 16-bit titles set the standard for console RPG and platformer games. The SNES continued Nintendo's dominance in the market and was also backward compatible with NES games.

### Entering the 3D Generation

The Nintendo 64 launched in 1996 as one of the earliest home consoles with 3D graphics. Pioneering games like Super Mario 64 showed what was possible on the new hardware. However, the N64's choice to use cartridges instead of CDs limited game size and hurt third party support. This lack of key multiplatform titles damaged sales compared to Sony's disc-based PlayStation.

### Struggling Against Competitors 

Released in 2001, the GameCube aimed to showcase Nintendo's technical abilities. But the console lacked features like online multiplayer that had become standard on competitors like the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Its mini discs also couldn't match the capacity of DVDs. Strong first-party exclusives failed to overcome a shortage of major third-party games, hampering sales.

### Finding Success with Motion Controls  

The Wii launched in 2006 with revolutionary motion controls that broadened gaming's audience appeal. Casual games like Wii Sports sold hardware by letting everyone easily participate. However, underpowered specs restricted many major third-party titles from being ported over. Still, over 100 million units were sold on the back of the innovative controller.

### Confusing Messaging Hinders the Wii U

Nintendo released the Wii U in 2012 with an innovative dual-screen gamepad, but confusing marketing led many to believe it was just an accessory for the original Wii. It also fell behind the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in terms of raw power. Combined with a lack of third-party support, this caused the Wii U to sell only 13 million units despite games like Super Mario 3D World.

### The Switch Revitalizes Sales  

Nintendo solved issues with the Switch's 2017 launch by combining home and portable gaming. Released alongside the acclaimed The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the Switch found mainstream success. Its hybrid design let players enjoy games on the TV or on the go. Flexibility and a strong lineup of first and third-party titles helped the Switch surpass 100 million sales in just five years.

### Nintendo's Legacy of Innovation
Despite struggles, Nintendo consoles defined eras through pioneering hardware and iconic franchises like Mario, Zelda, and others. These series have entertained millions of fans for decades. Nintendo continues pushing boundaries with creative designs like the Switch that redefine the player experience. The company's willingness to take risks ensures Nintendo will remain influential in the industry going forward.
