### Recapping the Backstories and Relationships of Michael, Franklin and Trevor

Michael is a retired criminal and former Biker in Witness Protection with a loving family. However, corrupt government agents have forced him back into a life of crime. Franklin is an ambitious young man from the streets who wants more from life. He looks up to Michael as a mentor figure. Trevor is Michael's oldest friend from their criminal pasts. Though unstable, he is fiercely loyal to his friends. Together, they worked to survive various heists and jobs, but personal conflicts grew between the three.

### Why Killing Michael is not an Option

Michael is like a father figure to Franklin, guiding him towards bigger goals and opportunities outside of street life. His experience and connections have helped Franklin progress quickly in the criminal underworld. Without Michael's mentoring, Franklin would lose an important role model pushing him to make more of himself...

### Why Killing Trevor is not an Option  

Though volatile, Trevor has proven time and again that he would give his life for his friends. He and Michael share a deep bond from their history together surviving impossible odds. While he clashes with Franklin, Trevor also respects the younger man's skills and grit. If Trevor were to die, it would devastate Michael and go against what their friendship represents...

### Why Siding with Corrupt Officials is Wrong

Devin Weston and Steve Haines used Michael, Franklin and Trevor as disposable tools in their private wars. They forced the trio back into dangerous schemes with no concern for their well-being. Siding with such treacherous characters goes against the protagonists' own moral code and jeopardizes their freedom...

### Choosing Deathwish Allows Vengeance on Betrayers 

Wei Cheng, Devin Weston and Steve Haines all crossed the trio in their quests for power and money. Choosing the Deathwish ending allows Michael, Franklin and Trevor to finally get justice for the ways these villains betrayed and endangered them at every turn. It satisfies the need for retaliation after so much manipulation...

### Game Mechanics Advantages of Keeping the Core Team Alive

With all three protagonists alive, players have access to expanded missions, properties, abilities and cutscenes exploring each character. Gameplay remains the most robust and compelling when the full dynamic between Michael, Franklin and Trevor can be experienced to its fullest...  

### Emotional Impact of Preserving the Friendships

Though they clash, it's clear the trio truly care for one another. Saving each other during missions highlights their bond despite past conflicts. Choosing Deathwish leaves them alive as a family to ride off into the sunset together, bringing narratively fulfilling closure to their journey...

### Franklin's Development Benefits from Mentor Figures

As the central perspective, Franklin's arc is best served continuing his relationships with Michael and Trevor. Their guidance has accelerated his success exponentially. To lose that would negatively impact Franklin's character growth and journey from street youth to respected criminal mastermind...

### Deathwish is the Only Satisfying Conclusion

All other endings fail to provide justice, cut short important character growth, or go against the heart of the narrative. Only Deathwish allows vengeance, preserves wholesome core bonds, and provides gameplay longevity. It's the sole option respecting the protagonists' full story while tying up loose threads in a cathartic way.
