### Debut with Intensity

Though the film failed, Randeep's intense act was noticed. Playing the lead role of a gangster, he showed glimpses of his raw acting prowess. Had the film worked, it could have propelled him to instant stardom. However, he took the failure in his stride and did not lose hope.
