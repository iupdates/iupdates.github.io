## Taking Public Transport
There are a few public transport options to get from Chicago to Bloomington-Normal, Illinois. The route will depend on where in Chicago you are starting from. 
If starting from anywhere inside the city limits of Chicago or northern suburbs like Evanston or Skokie, you can take the **Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)** electric trains or buses. The CTA operates the elevated train or "L" system within Chicago along with buses. On their website [CTA Maps](https://travelokie.github.io/assets/pdf/linux_essentials.pdf), you can find route maps and schedules for both bus and train lines. 
The CTA Electric line aka the Green Line runs south from downtown Chicago near the Chicago 'L' station. It can take you to locations like 35th-Bronzeville-IIT or 63rd where you can transfer to the Metra Electric District line. The Metra Electric District line then runs all the way south through Homewood, South Holland, Glenwood, Matteson, Richton Park, University Park and Ford Heights before reaching University Park/Matteson station.  
From University Park/Matteson station, you have the option to take a **Peoria Charter bus** which offers daily bus service to various locations in central Illinois like Bloomington-Normal, Peoria, Champaign etc. The Peoria Charter website **PeoriaCharter.com** provides route maps and schedules.
## Taking the Train 
If starting from downtown Chicago, you have the option of taking an Amtrak train to Bloomington-Normal. Amtrak operates daily train service from Chicago Union Station to Bloomington-Normal station. On their website, you can look at the train **schedule** and book tickets. The Amtrak train takes around 2 hours to reach Bloomington-Normal from Chicago Union Station.
## Driving Yourself
If you have your own vehicle, driving is another convenient option to get from Chicago to Bloomington-Normal. From Chicago, take I-55 South and drive for around 130 miles. Major cities you will pass through include Joliet, Pontiac, Dwight before reaching Bloomington-Normal. Allow 2.5-3 hours for the drive depending on traffic conditions. Driving yourself gives you the flexibility to leave at your preferred time but you have to factor in tolls and costs of parking your vehicle once in Bloomington-Normal.   
## Combination of Transport Modes
It is also possible to combine different modes of public transport to make the journey. For example, if starting from suburbs like Oak Park or Evanston in northern Chicago, take the CTA 'L' train to Chicago Union Station. Then switch to Amtrak for the 2 hour train ride to Bloomington-Normal station. Alternatively, one could take the Metra Electric train from the south side of Chicago to University Park/Matteson station and then switch to Peoria Charter bus. Using multiple modes allows you to access areas not directly served by one public transport provider.
## Starting from Southern Suburbs 
If starting from the southern suburbs of Chicago like Orland Park, Tinley Park, Homer Glen, the best option would be to drive to Joliet, Illinois. In Joliet, you can park your car and take the Peoria Charter bus service to Bloomington-Normal. Driving to Joliet first before switching to Peoria Charter bus avoids having to backtrack north towards Chicago city limits to access the Metra Electric line. The Peoria Charter website provides details on boarding locations and schedules from Joliet to Bloomington-Normal.
## When ISU is in Session  
During the academic year when Illinois State University (ISU) is in session, there are some additional transportation options available for students traveling between Chicago and Bloomington-Normal. ISU operates the **Redbird Express** , a shuttle bus service making multi-trips every weekend between ISU and Chicago subway terminal stops. Redbird Express drops off ISU students at the closest CTA subway terminal so they can complete their journey within the city using public transit. This provides a convenient option for ISU students to travel between the two cities on weekends.  
### Taking the Riskier Route
As a former ISU student myself, I had the freedom of having my own vehicle to make the trip between Chicago and Bloomington-Normal. Being a risk taker, I would drive **90 mph** on I-55 for the entire 130 mile journey and manage to reach Bloomington-Normal in only 90 minutes. Of course, driving at such high speeds is not advisable and comes with safety risks. The normal driving time with legal speed limits is around 2.5 hours one way.

## Comparing Options
In summary, the best options to get from Chicago to Bloomington-Normal depend on your starting location. Public transport via a combination of CTA-Metra-Amtrak or CTA-Peoria Charter provides a feasible option. Driving is flexible but involves parking costs. Starting from southern suburbs, taking the Peoria Charter bus from Joliet is direct. **Redbird Express is handy for ISU students**. Overall, doing some research on schedules and fares online helps pick the most suitable and cost-effective way to make the journey. Safe travels!
