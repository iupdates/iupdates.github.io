### Getting into London by Road 
There are several options available when driving into London from Kent and surrounding areas. One popular route is to take the [Blackwall Tunnel](https://iupdates.github.io/assets/pdf/linux.pdf) which crosses under the River Thames between Greenwich and Tower Hamlets. Be aware that there are often traffic delays at the Blackwall Tunnel due to its age and the high volume of vehicles that use it daily. Transport authorities have proposed introducing toll charges to help fund a new crossing known as the **Silvertown Tunnel project** which aims to alleviate congestion.  
Another option is to use the Dartford Crossing over the River Thames connecting Kent and Essex. While the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge is generally free-flowing, the approach roads on both sides can become congested during peak hours. The tolls on the Dartford Crossing help maintain the infrastructure.

### Greenwich Ferry: A Scenic River Crossing
For those wishing to avoid traffic jams and tunnels altogether, consider taking the passenger-only ferry service at Greenwich. The **Greenwich River Ferry** offers stunning river views and takes just a few minutes to cross between North Greenwich and Greenwich Pier. Be sure to check the ferry timetable in advance as only one small boat operates, meaning wait times can be significant if you miss a scheduled sailing. The ferry is free to use but has limited operating hours.
### Using Public Transport Within London
Once within London, using public transport is highly recommended to avoid traffic and parking hassles. The vast **London Underground network**, also known as the "Tube", provides an extremely efficient way to travel around the city and inner suburbs. Be aware that some Tube lines run limited night and weekend services. London also has an extensive **urban bus network** that can take you practically anywhere, though buses are affected by traffic conditions. For journeys to and from outer London areas, the **London Overground** heavy rail network offers a convenient alternative to driving. Downloading a transit app like Citymapper in advance allows you to plan journeys and see live updates on service disruptions. 
### Congestion Charges, Tolls and Low Emission Zones 
There are some important charges and zones to be aware of if driving in London. The city operates a **Congestion Charge** of Â£15 per day for most vehicles driving within the designated Central London zone between 7am-10pm on weekdays. There are also proposals to expand the charge area. Furthermore, since 2019, much of London has been designated an **Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)** where more polluting vehicles face a daily charge. This will expand further in late 2023. Be sure to check your vehicle meets ULEZ emissions standards to avoid fines. Toll charges also apply on some major river crossings like the **Dartford Crossing** and **Silvertown Tunnel** whenever they open. Building all these factors into budgeting and journey planning is recommended.
### Sightseeing and Attractions in London
Once in London, there is no shortage of world-class attractions to keep you occupied. Iconic landmarks like **Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Tower Bridge** and more can be easily reached on the Tube or by bus. For panoramic city views, a visit to the viewing platforms at **The Shard** or **The Sky Garden** are not to be missed. Culture vultures will want to spend time soaking in the collections at **The British Museum, National Gallery, Tate Modern** and other renowned museums and galleries. Experience London's vibrant energy by exploring the neighborhoods of Soho, Covent Garden and Camden Town. Don't forget comfortable walking shoes - London was made for exploring on foot! When planning your itinerary, consider buy multi-site passes or a Travelcard for unlimited public transport access within set zones.
### Day Trips Beyond Central London
London has so much more to offer beyond its famous landmarks. With easy access by national rail or motorway, interesting day trips are possible right from the heart of the city. Historic **Cambridge** with its picturesque college buildings and punting on the River Cam makes a delightful escape just an hour away by train. The seaside town of **Brighton** showcases England's love affair with the beach alongside quirky boutiques and cafes just over an hour south by rail or road. Family-friendly **Windsor Castle** and **Legoland Windsor** offer royal heritage and fun respectively, sitting on the outskirts of London less than an hour by train. For sweeping coastal scenery and historic port towns, the romantic **Kent coast** or **Suffolk coast** can be explored by car in a day. With so many rewarding day trips, allow extra time in your London itinerary to venture further afield.
### Navigating Beyond London: Onward Travel
When continuing your travels beyond London, there are excellent transportation links available. Two international airports serve the city - **Heathrow Airport** and **Gatwick Airport**. Both have direct rail connections from central London, taking 30-50 minutes respectively. For Channel ports and Eurostar services, head to **St Pancras International Station** to reach destinations like **Paris, Lille** and **Brussels** in under 3 hours by high-speed rail. National Express and Megabus operate affordable coach services from **Victoria Coach Station** to many British cities. For driving onwards, the M25 orbital motorway provides access to major roads like the M1, M3, M4 and M20 to travel to all corners of England, Scotland, Wales and beyond. With so many options, you'll be well set to continue exploring the UK and beyond after your stay in this remarkable capital city.
