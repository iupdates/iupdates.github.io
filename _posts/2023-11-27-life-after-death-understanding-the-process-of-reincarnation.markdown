Reincarnation is a widely held spiritual belief that the soul or spirit, after physical death, comes back to earth in another body. However, the specifics of this process are not well understood. Through hypnosis therapy sessions and accounts from spirit guides, some insights have emerged about what occurs between physical lives. In this article, we will explore various perspectives on [life after death experiences](https://jnewshub.github.io/2023-11-02-marijuana-possession-laws-and-usage-risks-in-the-dominican-republic/) and the different stages involved in preparation for a new lifetime.
### Coming Back to Life 
The individual who wrote about being declared legally dead seven times and experiencing nearly nine and a half minutes without breathing or a heartbeat provided a compelling firsthand account of **recovering from clinical death**. While they did not see any visions, they described an overwhelming sense of peace during the period of unconsciousness. Their doctors were understandably shocked when this person unexpectedly awoke and spoke only a few days after being admitted to ICU in critical condition. This story demonstrates that **returning from the brink of death** is indeed possible under some extraordinary circumstances.

### Pondering the Purpose 
Looking back after several years of sobriety, the author pondered the deeper significance of surviving when others in similar situations did not. Without a clear answer to why they were spared, they focused on sharing a message of hope for those struggling with addiction or mental health issues. **Finding meaning in difficult experiences** can help one stay grounded and dedicated to personal growth even when the future remains uncertain. Their willingness to reflect publicly on these profound questions may help others feel less alone in their own challenges.
### Insights from Past Life Therapy 
A therapist trained in accessing past life memories through hypnosis assisted one client in realizing she had chosen to **take over another's soul contract** in a time of crisis. Feeling lost or disconnected for years, this revelation brought her peace by recognizing her higher purpose in spontaneously **subbing in to ensure the fulfillment of others' soul plans**. Accounts like this provide a window into how **spiritual guides may intervene between lifetimes** to resolve unexpected disruptions to the spiritual evolution of multiple souls.
### Communication from Spirit Allies 
Two discarnate beings speaking through another shared perspectives on the process of reincarnation based on their observations from the spirit world. Key stages included a **life review period** lasting weeks to years to fully integrate lessons. Most souls opt to **reincarnate within a year** to continue growing, though some remain in the spirit realm for decades or centuries before taking another physical form. Each person follows their own **soul's agenda for growth** through experiences on Earth or in the non-physical realms between lives. 
### Transitioning to the Afterlife 
Upon passing, sources described spirits traversing **seven stages of transition** over an indeterminate time frame. During the plane of learning phase, the life review absorption often comprises the bulk of this initial adjustment **away from earthly identification**. Additional preparation then takes place specifically geared toward the next rebirth choice depending on **evolved spiritual needs and agreements**. Rather than a fixed cycle, the intricacies appear **unique to each soul's circumstances and choices**.
### Deciding on a New Path 
Eventually, spirits working closely with their guides collaboratively opt into their setting for the next phase of evolution. Locations incorporate **diverse places beyond just Earth.** Though generally encouraged to reincarnate promptly to continue accrual of wisdom, one can always elect to stay non-physically **as long as see fit for rest or observation**. Instances were shared where **last-minute Earthside substitutions occurred** at guides' bequest to remedy unexpected disruptions in planned lessons between associates. 
### Taking Time to Process 
Overall, the reincarnation cycle seems highly individualized depending on a soul's internal rate of **readiness for new growth opportunities**. While most integrate learnings within 12 months of departing the body, others require significantly more detached contemplation **before embracing another lifetime's responsibilities**. Neither approaching spirit nor the hypnotic client reported feeling restricted timeframe-wise in their afterlife activities or rebirth decisions. Both emphasized progression transpiring based on each person's autonomous inclinations rather than any external imperatives.
