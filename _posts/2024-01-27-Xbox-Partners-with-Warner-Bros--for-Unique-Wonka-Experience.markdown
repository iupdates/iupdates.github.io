### A Tasty Treat  
In perhaps the most unique element of the promotion, Xbox will be crafting the world's first edible gaming controller. The controller will be made entirely out of chocolate and neatly wrapped in golden foil. Fans who obtain this one-of-a-kind item will be able to enjoy both a gaming session and a sweet snack all in one. Only a select number of chocolate controllers will be given away.

This vibrant partnership allows Xbox to pay tribute to Roald Dahl's timeless children's classic. The magical world of Wonka has inspired wonder and imagination for both young and old for generations. By integrating gaming elements, Xbox hopes to introduce Dahl's iconic characters to new fans. The bespoke bundle and edible prop help bring the story to life in an interactive way.

### Scarcity Breeds Excitement
Given the special nature and effort that went into these limited edition items, Xbox and Warner Bros. are keeping quantities very constrained. Fans will need to act quickly to enter forthcoming sweepstakes for a chance at the console bundle or chocolate controller.

 ### A Dream Come True
