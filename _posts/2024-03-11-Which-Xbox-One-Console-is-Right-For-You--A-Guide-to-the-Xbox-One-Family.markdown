## Original Xbox One vs Xbox One S

The original Xbox One was released in 2013 and featured an external power brick with less powerful internals compared to newer models. While still capable of playing all the latest games, it lacked support for 4K capabilities and had a larger physical size taking up more space. 

The redesigned Xbox One S released in 2016 addressed many of the issues with the original. By moving to an internal power supply, the S shed nearly 50% of its size and bulk. Game and app performance remained the same, but enhanced hardware allowed for 4K video playback and streaming. The improved components ran cooler and more efficiently as well. For buyers looking at Xbox options today, the Xbox One S is the better choice over hunting down a used original model.

### Differences in Size and Features

Standing nearly 50% smaller and lighter, the compact design of the Xbox One S won many fans over the bulky launch unit. Gone was the external power brick, replaced by an internal supply. 4K video playback and streaming capabilities through apps like Netflix and YouTube was a major addition. While gaming performance stayed the same at 1080p, the enhancements positioned the S as a premium home entertainment device.

### Recommendation for New Buyers   

Unless finding an exceptional deal on a well-cared for used original, new Xbox buyers today are best off with the Xbox One S. The upgrades in size, features and tech like 4K video make it the better value compared to the aging 2013 launch console. Servicing from Microsoft and reliable game compatibility are also more assured on the newer hardware revision.

## Choosing Between Xbox One or Xbox One S 

For those already owning the original Xbox One, there may not be enough added value to warrant an upgrade to the One S yet. Gameplay is identical between the two at standard 1080p resolutions. Unless utilizing a 4K TV regularly, buyers can stick with their launch unit until the upgraded Project Scorpio arrives. 

However, the Xbox One S is the better choice for secondary family systems or new adopters on a budget. Used original consoles can save $100-$150 but sacrifice things like compact size and potential service support further down the line. Overall the improved experience and features make the modest $50 premium of the One S the wisest investment.

### Keeping the Original Xbox One 

Don't feel compelled to upgrade if fully happy with the gaming on the original Xbox One. As with any electronic, proper ventilation and occasional cleaning can keep things running smoothly for years. Console makers focus heavily on reliability, and Microsoft will support the launch unit through future OS and game compatibility updates. Performance may gradually decrease over many years of constant downloads and usage, but day one systems can ideally serve until replacement. 

## Project Scorpio (Xbox One X)

Project Scorpio, now officially named the Xbox One X, promises to be the most powerful console ever constructed once it launches in fall 2017. Under the hood will be specs significantly exceeding any other system, including upgrades like a liquid cooled CPU and GPU specifically designed for true 4K gaming. The targeted performance level opens opportunities for virtual reality and super high resolution that only a dedicated device can offer.

### Power for 4K and Beyond 

While prior Xbox models could play 4K video files, Project Scorpio is engineered from the start for high end 4K gameplay. Targeting 6 teraflops of graphical processing power, games will render natively at 4K with enhanced visuals like texture detail and smoother frame rates. The horsepower boost likewise means Project Scorpio can run augmented reality and virtual reality experiences at their full potential. 

### Recommendation for 4K Owners and VR Fans

Buyers with a 4K television looking for state of the art graphics should likely hold off for Project Scorpio's launch later in 2017. Especially those interested in virtual reality gaming, its targeted power exceeds all systems today. While an investment, for the audience who wants cutting edge home entertainment Scorpio seems poised to deliver that and more once available.

## Confusion Over Xbox Names

One drawback Microsoft created with its console naming has been confusion distinguishing new models. While meant to all be part of the "Xbox One" family, consumers understandably struggle separating the original, One S update, and forthcoming Project Scorpio/Xbox One X. 

Performance gains between the launch Xbox One and newer revisions likewise blur understanding. The Xbox One S looks nearly identical, yet some mistake its upgrades as a full generational leap rather than iterative improvements. 

For clarity - the original Xbox One from 2013 set the initial standard. Two years later the Xbox One S refreshed the design. While enhanced, games run at the same quality. Project Scorpio arriving this fall will offer a true successor experience through massive power gains supporting higher resolutions and graphical effects. Consumers should consider the naming situation when comparing options.

## Keeping an Original Xbox One  

Fear of a console suddenly becoming obsolete should not drive existing owners to upgrade. The original Xbox One was built with longevity in mind thanks to Microsoft's system-wide approach. Much like PC gaming, gradual performance decreases may happen over many years of heavy use. But the vast software library will remain compatible for the lifespan.

### Console Care Extends Lifespan

Some easy steps keep consoles maintaining peak function. Adequate ventilation prevents overheating from long gaming marathons. Light dust cleaning prevents Component issues. Updated system software takes care of bugs and security concerns long-term as well. Original Xbox One's hard drives likewise support large memory upgrades alleviating storage limits. With attention, launch units can reliably handle gaming for many great gaming years to come without upgrading.

## All Digital Xbox One S 

A lesser known variant hardware revision is the digital-only Xbox One S model. Appearance and capabilities remain otherwise identical compared to the standard disc drive equipped One S, with one major difference - the absence of a Blu-ray/DVD drive. This alteration was made strictly to accommodate a lower $50 decrease in retail cost. 

While unable to play physical discs, the digital Xbox One S downloads and runs all games, apps, streaming services, and system software identically to disc equipped models. Internal hardware specifications do not differ either. The lower barrier of entry opens Xbox gaming affordably for digital shoppers. An internet connected is a requirement, but performance stays on par otherwise.

## Differences Between Original and One S

### Internal Power Supply and Slim Design

Externally one of the most noticeable upgrades on the One S was consolidating the power brick internally. This allowed for a radically slimmer industrial design shedding nearly 50% of bulk. Along with more stable power delivery, the internal space savings were a boon for home entertainment centers.

### 4K Media Playback and Extra Ports  

While identical for games rendered at 1080p, the enhanced GPU muscle of the One S unlocked support for high resolution 4K video playback through streaming apps, disc, and external storage. Additional rear USB ports complemented the relocated front facing port as well for peripherals. 

## Choosing Between One S Models  

Unless 4K gaming is essential, most will find the standard One S a worthy buying option over the original thanks to its refinements. However, those with budgets allowing should consider waiting until later this year when Project Scorpio debuts with its massive graphical leap. Purchasing the currently available One S keeps users in the Xbox ecosystem while they save up as well. The digital Xbox One S also opens gaming affordably without physical media if preferred. Overall the simplified choices suit varied modern lifestyles.

## Long Term Use of Consoles

Consoles are engineered to deliver gaming reliability for half a decade or longer. Constant downloads and intense gameplay sessions theoretically impact performance over the very long haul. However, with proper care even early models age gracefully. Common prudent steps maximize lifespan:

- Keep consoles in well ventilated open areas to dissipate heat from cramped entertainment centers. 

- Light debris cleaning of interior vents and exterior prevents dust buildup hindering airflow. 

- Use energy saving features like turning off when not in use to avoid unnecessary component wear during idleness.

- Hard drive upgrades extend usable space as libraries grow without rebuying down the road.  

Prioritizing these simple maintenance rituals during ownership ensures maximizing joy from each machine for many great gaming years to come.
