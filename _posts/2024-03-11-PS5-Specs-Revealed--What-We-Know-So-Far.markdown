### Hardware Specs
The PS5 will feature an 8-core, 16 thread CPU based on AMD's third generation Ryzen line and a custom GPU based on RDNA 2 architecture. This will provide significantly more processing power than the PS4. The CPU will have increased clock speeds for faster performance while the custom RDNA 2 GPU promises stunning visuals with support for real-time ray tracing. Ray tracing recreates the way light behaves in the real world, allowing for more realistic lighting, reflections and shadows in games. 

The PS5 also includes an ultra-high speed SSD for storage with a capacity of around 825GB. Loading times in games should be virtually eliminated as developers can stream assets directly from the SSD. Expandable storage is available through M.2 SSD slots on the console which will support external drives with equal or faster speed than the internal SSD. This storage solution gives developers freedom to create larger, richer game worlds without sacrificing load times.

### Backward Compatibility
Sony showcased backwards compatibility on the PS5 hardware by running several major PS4 titles. This feature allows the 100 million+ PS4 users to play their existing library on the new console. In addition, PS5 games will still be playable on PS4 systems, giving developers flexibility to create cross-generational games. Popular franchises like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Bloodborne, Ghost of Tsushima will be forward compatible allowing players to pick up where they left off. 

### New Controller Features 
The DualSense controller is the most significant update ever for PlayStation controllers. It introduces haptic feedback providing variable resistance through the triggers and subtle vibration patterns through the controller body. This replaces the simple rumble of previous controllers for a much more immersive feel. The adaptive triggers can simulate various actions like pullingback a bowstring or accelerating a vehicle. Additionally, the built-in microphone allows for ease of voice communication without a headset. 

### Improved Audio
Through 3D audio support, the PS5 aims to give players a more surround sound experience regardless if using a TV, soundbar or headphones. Audio engineers have found ways for the hardware and software to recognize object-based sound so audio comes from everywhere, including above and behind players. This should provide atmosphere and positional awareness to completely elevate the way games sound. 

### Potential Launch Games
Being backward compatible with the PS4 means many top titles could get free upgrades to take advantage of the PS5's horsepower. First-party Sony franchises have been confirmed to continue like Horizon Zero Dawn 2, Spider-Man 2, God of War 2 and The Last of Us Part 2. These are potential system sellers as launch titles redesigned from the ground up for the new console. Multiplayer games and blockbuster third party titles may also launch day one or receive upgrades simultaneously on both generations.

### Potential Launch Date  
Though an official release date hasn't been announced, Sony has stated the PS5 will be available for the 2020 holiday season. Many expect a November launch to capitalize on Black Friday and Christmas sales. However, some specualte an earlier October date or specifically May 5th, 2020 which would mark "05/05/20" as an auspicious number combination. Sony will reveal the exact date within the next few months once production and shipping logistics are finalized.

### Price Estimates
Industry analysts believe Sony will price the PS5 competitively against Microsoft's Xbox Series X to attract the biggest install base possible. Based on the leading-edge components and 4K/8K capability planned, most believe a $399-$499 range is likely. At the upper end, this represents a modest $100 or less increase over the PS4's launch MSRP while providing vastly more advanced graphics, performance and features. An attractive price point is important to convince gamers to buy into the new generation.

### Online Services
Similar to PS4, the PS5 ecosystem will continue delivering online multiplayer gaming, digital storefront access for game and content downloads, cloud saves and likely expand services like PlayStation Now game streaming. A continued focus on community features and exclusive games/content will keep the PlayStation brand at the forefront of the console market. Backward compatibility also maintains the value of existing online networks player have built up.

### Development is Ongoing
While these PS5 details currently known offer a promising glimpse, full specifications and the user experience are still works in progress. Sony will share more information as the new console nears completion and prepares for launch later this year. Key aspects like final specs, UI design, services and pricing models may still evolve based on developer and consumer feedback. Through 2019 and early 2020, additional announcements unveiling the system's full potential can be expected to stoke further hype leading into the holiday season.
