### A Harebrained Scheme
I had a crazy idea to travel through time and purchase the unreleased GTA 7 game from the future. Despite warnings that time travel wasn't possible, I was determined to try building a machine and gathering materials. It seemed unrealistic but my curiosity was piqued. Little did I know the challenges I was about to face on this wild goose chase.

### Directions Made No Sense  
Online guides claimed installing GTA 4 and 3 together would unlock GTA 7, which made no logical sense. The games aren't related and a future sequel wouldn't be accessible that way. Another said to wait years for GTA 6 and 7 releases, clearly ignoring reality. None of the "instructions" had a foundation in scientific possibility.

### Mobile Dreams Were Fantasy
I thought maybe mobile phones could run the big future game if PCs couldn't handle it. However, flagship phones today lack power for current AAA titles. GTA 5 still pushes high-end PCs years later. Mobile ports simplify graphics, not deliver full console experiences. Wishing a hypothetical game onto phones ignored these technological limits.

### Harsh Truths Provided Clarity 
Commenters gently tried informing me it wasn't possible. When I didn't listen, one bluntly said I lacked sense. They explained I was dismissing hardware and software limitations. I began realizing my plan wasn't grounded, just a fanciful daydream incapable of coming true no matter my enthusiasm. 

### No Legal Avenues Existed
Hoping official stores may offer it early, I searched all major platforms and stores. But GTA 6 isn't out yet alone a sequel years further. Torrents only contained malware posing as the game. Legally, no legitimate method obtained a nonexistent product. Commercial and technological realities couldn't be bypassed.

### A Quixotic Quest  
After fruitless weeks chasing improbable solutions, I reached a dead end. Every path led nowhere because the game doesn't truly exist. Despite sincere efforts to make it work, reality couldn't be denied or hacked. All that remained was acknowledging the Don Quixote-like nature of this mission.

### Understanding Was Gained
It's clear with hindsight I grasped at straws from the outset. Enthusiasm is good but facts must guide expectations. Wishful thinking can't override what's technologically or commercially viable. This experience taught not to ignore reasoning for fantasies.

### Patience and the Future
One day if GTA 7 materializes, it may come to new consoles and PCs. But that's years away, so eagerly anticipating now is premature. I'll enjoy the franchise unfolding naturally instead of rushing the unformed future. Hopefully advancing tech enables dreams that seem impossible today.

### The End of a Fool's Errand
With appreciation for well-meaning guidance, I accept defeat. With time travel implausible, this misguided scheme concludes. While imagination sparked it, logic showed infeasibility. Now I understand better to wait for real progress, not flights of fancy.
