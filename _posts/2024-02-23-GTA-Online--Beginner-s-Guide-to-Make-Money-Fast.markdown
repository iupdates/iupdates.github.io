## Introduction
Making money efficiently as a new player in GTA Online can be challenging. This guide outlines effective strategies for beginners to start earning money fast. There are many opportunities in the game to earn money, both actively and passively. By following some basic steps, you can quickly build your bank balance and unlock more lucrative businesses.

## Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack  
One option for a head start is investing $10 in the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack. This unlocks a range of bonuses to boost your finances from the get-go. You'll receive an apartment, CEO office, bike club, and more to immediately begin earning income. With the Starter pack, you'll have possessions needed to start some businesses and access higher paying missions from the start.

### Start Earning with the Starter Businesses
The apartment, CEO office, and bike club from the Starter Pack allow you to get started with Criminal and Freemode work right away. Use your new CEO office to register as a VIP/CEO and do VIP work like "Headhunter" for $20k-30k every 20 minutes. The bike club allows doing motorcycle contract missions for up to $15k each, and owning property lets you host gameplay modes like "King of the Hill" to earn money and RP too.

## Contact Missions & Daily Challenges  
When first beginning, Rockstar contact missions provide accessible ways to earn. They let you learn gameplay and earn a small profit each time, helping familiarize yourself with the map, vehicles and combat. Daily challenges reward $30k if all three are completed in one day, giving extra incentive to hop on. Complete one mission or challenge per session to stack easy money while learning systems.

### Practice and Profit from Contact Missions
Start with intro missions like "Blow Up" and "Dry Docking" that only take 15 minutes and pay $12-18k. Running a few of these easy missions each play session will quickly add up your cash. They are also a low commitment way to start learning vehicle handling, combat tactics and earning RP alongside cash simultaneously. Look up mission guides online if you get stuck. Daily challenges provide additional income with minimal effort too.

## Vehicle Warehouse Import/Export
Once you've built up some finances, source and sell high-end cars with the Vehicle Warehouse. Buy a crate warehouse and vehicle warehouse properties then only source and sell top range cars to maximize profits of $80k each sale. It takes about 15 minutes per high-end car sale and is one of the steadiest moneymakers. Combining import/export missions with crates or other tasks makes efficient use of your play time.

### Import High-End Only for Maximum Profits  
When sourcing vehicles for your Warehouse, only ever obtain the most expensive "Top Range" cars worth $80k each upon export. Store all other vehicles instead of selling them. This ensures you only source the most lucrative vehicles worth the most money. Over time, the Warehouse will fill up with duplicates of the other cars and will only allow you to source Top Range ones maximizing profits with each 15 minute sale cycle.

## Biker Business Upgrades
Once established, MC businesses like the Cocaine Lockup unlock. Fully upgrading these generates product to sell passively in the background while doing other work. Maximize your profits by upgrading staff and equipment in each business before production begins. With all five businesses fully upgraded and technicians assigned, you can generate over $1,000,000 daily without much active work needed.

### Maximize Production and Profits
 Invest in both the staff and equipment upgrades for each business like the cocaine lockup to maximize production volume and quality. Fully upgraded, the businesses produce much more valuable product per unit of time spent. Assign your imported technicians from the Nightclub to actively accrue stock while you are away or doing other work. With the five businesses upgraded, you can earn huge sums passively in the long run.

## Treasure Hunts for Extra Cash
Treasure maps found around the GTA map provide an easy way for players to earn more upfront cash. Completing the various Treasure Hunts and finding the buried stashes rewards $10,000 to $25,000 each with very minimal effort invested beyond searching for clues. Hunting treasure lets you boost your funds on the side while engaged in other activities. 

### Boost Funds with Low Effort Treasure Hunting
Keep an eye out for the randomly spawned treasure maps around the map, or purchase maps online if in a rush. Once acquired, follow the clues to efficiently locate the buried loot. Treasure hunts require only a vehicle and some problem solving, making for a low stress way to increase funds in small chunks. Do a hunt or two when you have some spare time for low effort extra cash flows.

## The Big Wheel for Free Spin
The casino lets you spin the Lucky Wheel once per day for a chance at payouts ranging from $5,000 up to $50,000 or even a mystery prize. Stop by every 24 hours for your daily free spin with zero risk other than some time spent. With beginners focused on building wealth, every little bit helps - and lucky spins provide an injection of cash for little time spent at the tables. 

### Spin Daily for Potential Jackpots
 Spend just a couple minutes each day visiting the casino to spin the Lucky Wheel for free. With no risks or costs besides time, hit the slots daily on the off chance you hit a big cash or vehicle jackpot potentially worth five figures or more. Even modest 5-10k wins contribute meaningfully to wealth growth for new players. Make spinning the daily wheel part of your routine for a chance at easy money.

## Contact Missions & Races  
Contact missions provide reliable income, especially popular ones like "Blow Up" paying $12-18k in about 15-20 minutes. Run a few of these lucrative repeatable missions each session for steady profits while improving combat skills. Races also award cash prizes and are generally fun ways for new players to learn driving dynamics. Mixing missions and races breaks up gameplay and fattens wallets simultaneously.

### Stack Cash and Skills Simultaneously  
Choose contact missions and Adversary Modes that interest you and can be completed quickly, focusing on ones paying at least $10k for a 15 minute commitment. Mix things up with user created content too for diversity. Races teach valuable driving skills in an engaging format, so do a circuit or two between missions for additional payouts and practice. Building skills while stacking cash through varied gameplay ensures steady progression.  

## Invest Profits into Nightclub    
After some businesses like an Import/Export Warehouse and MC businesses are activated and producing product, invest in the Nightclub. Assign technicians to each business type (cocaine, weed etc) and eventually five technicians can be bought. Acting passively, the Nightclub will generate over $1,000,000 in profit each game day without needing active work from the player.

### Generate $1M+ Daily with No Work
Once established, focus on purchasing storage levels and technicians for your Nightclub. technicians will passively accrue stock from linked businesses like Biker operations and Import/Export while you are playing or away completely. With five businesses linked and upgraded plus all five Nightclub technicians, you can log in daily to around $1.1 million in completed sales with zero effort beyond initial setup. The Nightclub allows immense wealth growth with no work needed as rewards.
