## Introduction 
Microsoft Rewards is a loyalty program that allows users to earn points simply by searching with Bing and engaging in other activities on Microsoft platforms like Xbox and the Microsoft Store. Points can then be redeemed for gift cards from popular retailers or exchanged for other rewards like game subscriptions or Microsoft Store credit. Signing up is free and only requires linking a Microsoft account. Once registered, there are daily opportunities to earn points through searches, quizzes, purchases and more. 

### Getting Started with Microsoft Rewards
To join Microsoft Rewards, visit the official website and use your existing Microsoft account credentials or create a new one if needed. This links your account activity to start tracking points. The setup only takes a few minutes. Once logged in, you'll see the current point balance and have access to the full Rewards catalog and daily opportunities.

### Daily Point Earning Opportunities
In addition to earning points through searches and other qualifying activities, Microsoft Rewards offers a rotating selection of daily quizzes, polls and short surveys. These "engagement actions" provide a consistent stream of easy points just for spending a minute or two each day on the site. Streak bonuses are also awarded for completing engagement actions on consecutive days.

## Earning points with Bing searches
Bing is integrated with Microsoft Rewards, allowing users to earn points with every search performed on the Bing homepage, search bar extensions or through the Microsoft Edge browser. Standard searches earn a small amount of points while using the homepage or Edge provides additional multipliers. Search activity is tracked in the Rewards dashboard to stay on top of accumulated points from this passive earning method.

### Additional points through Bing bonuses
In addition to the standard points per search, Bing will sometimes offer bonus points for specific search topics or performing a certain number of searches in a day. These limited-time bonuses provide an easy way to boost daily points totals with regular search habits. Users should keep an eye out for any applicable bonuses listed on the Rewards homepage each time they perform searches.

## Microsoft Store purchases and in-app purchases  
Making eligible purchases through the Microsoft Store, such as apps, games or subscriptions, earns Microsoft Rewards points. The points awarded are usually calculated as a small percentage of the total purchase amount. Downloading free apps still provides a flat points amount. Qualifying in-app purchases within apps downloaded through the Microsoft Store, like bonus in-game currencies or expansions, also contribute points. Tracking purchase history allows Rewards members to see the different amounts earned over time from digital spending through a Microsoft platform.

### Additional redemption options for Microsoft Store purchases
In addition to earning points on Microsoft Store purchases, Rewards members can redeem their accumulated points for Microsoft Store credit or discounts. This provides flexibility to defray the cost of future qualified store purchases through points earned from earlier spending. Redeeming points for store value is a great incentive for using the Microsoft digital storefront for applications and subscriptions over alternatives.

## Xbox activities for points
Gamers who play Xbox consoles can join in on the points earning through their gameplay. Regular activities like achieving accomplishments in games, completing challenges, and investing time into selected free-to-play titles all provide Rewards points on a periodic basis. Any purchases made through the Xbox Store or for Xbox Live Gold memberships also contribute to points tallies. 

### Monthly bonuses for Xbox fans
In addition to points from regular gameplay, Rewards offers monthly bonuses optimized for the Xbox audience. Examples include multipliers for points earned from specific titles or publishers during promotional periods. There are also often sweepstakes drawings or instant-win prizes accessible through special in-game rewards promotions. These themed bonuses encourage Xbox users to maximizeRewards integration while enjoying their hobby.

## Engage with quizzes, surveys and polls
The Rewards homepage and dashboard feature quick daily activities specifically designed for effortless points. Quizzes presenting trivia or testing general knowledge allow users to earn points simply for answering questions. Ditto for short single-question surveys or opinion polls on various topics. These can often be completed in under a minute apiece.

### Streak bonuses for engagement
Rewards members earn a flat quantity of points each time they participate in the available quizzes or polls. However, streak bonuses are also awarded for completing engagement activities on consecutive days. Maintaining a seven-day streak doubles the base points, while 30-day and longer streaks provide even higher multipliers. The streak system encourages staying active with the program on a daily rhythm.

## Shop with Rewards partners 
Microsoft Rewards is partnered with numerous major retailers and brands where members can earn bonus points through shopping activities. Qualifying online or in-store purchases at these third-party locations contribute directly to a user's Rewards balance. Dining out at selected restaurant chains will also earn additional points on top of the purchase amount. 

### Ongoing points through entertainment subscriptions
Subscribing to popular music or video streaming services through Rewards partners is another way to earn ongoing points over time. Qualified ongoing subscriptions like Spotify Premium or Hulu contribute small amounts of points on a monthly basis. This "set it and forget it" approach allows effortless supplementary earnings when opting into recurring bills through the Rewards network.

## Redeem points for gift cards
The most common redemption option is exchanging accumulated points for digital gift cards from popular retailers. Standards include Amazon, Target, Walmart, and many other major brands. Minimum point values required depend on the denomination - for example, a $5 Amazon gift card costs 1500 points while higher amounts mean more points are needed. Gift cards provide flexibility to redeem earnings in a broadly useful format.

### Additional minor rewards
For smaller point balances, Rewards offers alternatives to gift cards. Smaller miscellaneous rewards include sweepstakes entries, charity donations, or custom digital wallpapers. And as points totals climb, higher value redemptions unlock like Microsoft Store promotions and Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. There are redemption options to suit varied goals and collection rates.

## Maximize points with bonuses and promotions
Microsoft Rewards runs bonus point periods throughout the year centered around gaming releases, retail events, and seasonal campaigns to encourage activity. These multipliers double or even quadruple points earned through specific qualifying actions for a limited time. Users should look out for any applicable bonuses like this listed on the Rewards homepage. 

### Maintain monthly streaks  
Compared to the standard daily tasks, achieving 30-day plus streaks for engagement actions results in massive points multipliers. Staying continuously active provides the largest supplementary payouts over standard earnings. It's worthwhile for Rewards fans to cement steady participation as a monthly routine for maximum optimization.

### Referral bonuses for new members
The Rewards program offers members points for referring others to join through an invitation link. Both the new users and existing members who referred them receive a one-time bonus upon signup completion. Growing the Rewards network provides a way for participants to earn supplementary referral points passively by spreading awareness of the program.

So in summary - Microsoft Rewards provides a straightforward loyalty system open to all. By aggregating data from existing internet habits and Microsoft platforms, it allows members to benefit through both passive and active everyday activities. With careful optimization of the various complementary earning methods and redemption options, Rewards is a useful program well worth optimizing for avid Microsoft users.
