### Getting Hooked but Too Confrontational 

Reddit is a massive online community where I've wasted countless hours over the years. I originally joined to participate in discussions across many niche subreddits focused on my interests like movies, sports, and technology. However, I had a habit of getting into arguments in the comment sections, often saying things that crossed lines or came across as hostile. This led to multiple accounts being permanently suspended over the years for violating subreddit rules or Reddit's content policy. At first I'd get a 3 day ban but the infractions kept piling up until I was permanently locked out with no way to appeal it.

### No Explanations and Unhelpful Appeals

When an account is permanently suspended, Reddit offers no explanation or specifics on what exactly caused the ban. All appeals are automatically denied without any human review. This "guilty until proven innocent" approach leaves users in the dark. Even creating new accounts from a different device or internet connection didn't help - they would get suspended within hours for "ban evasion." It became clear the admins had no interest in due process or actually addressing user concerns once a ban occurred.

### Circumventing Through Apple 

Out of frustration, I decided to try creating a new account using a different email and Apple ID since my previous suspensions were all linked to the same login credentials. Surprisingly, this new account has stayed active for over 6 months now without any bans. However, there is always a risk as Reddit can likely detect ban evasion through things like IP address, browser fingerprints, or geolocation data. Staying under the radar requires extra steps to avoid being linked back to my original banned accounts.

### Minor Infractions Still Risk Suspension

Browsing popular subreddits, it's shocking how many mundane comments still get users into trouble. Simply joking around or quoting something out of context that gets misinterpreted can trigger other users to mass report. I've seen many suspended for comments that seemed perfectly harmless but violated an overly broad or vague rule. Suspensions often feel disproportionate and unfair for minor first-time infractions. Zero tolerance policies don't consider intent or nuance, punishing trolls and casual users the same.

### Gradually Building Positive Karma

With this new clean slate account, my goal is to avoid any risk of future suspensions. I've been focusing on communities centered around my real interests like movies, travel, and technology - staying away from political topics that usually lead to arguments. Instead of diving into every debate, I post thoughtful comments, questions, and original content. Gradually my karma score has increased organically through positive engagement. This nurtures my role as a constructive community member rather than an antagonistic one.

### Avoiding VPNs and Proxies  

Some users try obscuring their identity by signing in through VPNs or proxy servers, but this often backfires. Reddit has tools to detect abnormal login patterns from changed IP addresses that don't align with a user's location history. Any anomalies raise red flags for ban evasion. It's best to access the site normally from your regular devices and internet connections. An identifiable digital footprint builds trust over time versus hiding behind anonymity, which maintains the appearance of trying to avoid detection or accountability for past violations.  

### Following All Rules Carefully

Each subreddit community maintains its own set of additional rules beyond Reddit's overall content policy. Carefully reading sidebar descriptions and pinned posts is important to fully understand what is or isn't allowed in a given space before participating. Even well-intentioned comments can cross lines if context is missed. I make extra effort double checking rules to avoid simple mistakes, like not reading a community's FAQ beforehand. Treading lightly and asking clarifying questions is better than assuming and risking another ban down the line.

### Accepting Platform Changes  

Over the years, Reddit's focus has shifted more towards mass appeal and profitability compared to open discussion. Tighter moderation policies and vague rules make it too easy for accounts to get suspended without warning. The platform is well within their rights to prioritize growth over individual users. However, this means individual users must also accept when a site no longer aligns with their interests and move to alternatives. Clinging to platforms slowly killing what made them useful wastes energy better spent building new spaces.

### Learning From Mistakes  

Getting permanently banned taught valuable lessons about respecting community guidelines, considering how my words impact others, and choosing interactions wisely. With this restarted account, I'm determined to positively contribute instead of antagonize. Focusing discussion on shared interests versus conflicts keeps interactions upbeat. Ultimately, online spaces should bring people together rather than divide them. My journey shows that changing perspectives and habits is key to enjoying community engagement long-term within reasonable guidelines.

### Finding Balance and Alternatives

Reddit, like most platforms, struggles with balancing open discourse against managing problematic users. Over time, their approach has shifted towards a "nanny state" model of strict rules and quick bans versus due process. For many, this stifles authentic engagement. Moving forward, I'll remain active on Reddit within guidelines while also exploring alternative discussion forums with a commitment to open yet respectful exchange of diverse viewpoints. Community is about bringing varied lives together, not driving them apart due censorship or toxicity on any side. A multiplicity of spaces, each with their strengths, can better serve open societies.
