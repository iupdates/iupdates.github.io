As Sara Matthews asked, finding books that are interesting and engaging is key to developing reading stamina. British writers are often better at crafting mysteries and thrillers that entertain without relying solely on violence. Some classic authors to consider include Agatha Christie, Patricia Wentworth, and Dorothy L. Sayers. For lighthearted adventures, try Douglas Adams or P.G. Wodehouse. The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling is also highly accessible for many readers. Be sure to search online for free ebook downloads of these titles to try without cost. An iPad can be a versatile tool for reading electronically on the go without extra baggage.
### Young Adult Fiction for Beginners
Unless one truly enjoys 19th century style and language, classic literature may present too many obstacles at first. Young Adult (YA) fiction uses more contemporary language and references while still tackling a variety of interesting genres. Try selecting titles related to your preferred subjects like science fiction, fantasy with historical elements, romance or mysteries. These stories engage readers while easing the transition to English. Begin with short chapters and build from there.  
### Pacing Yourself with Short Sessions
Getting tired of reading often happens when attempting too much at once. Start small with 5-10 minute sessions, then take a break for other tasks before resuming. Gradually extend sessions by 5 minutes each week until reaching 30-45 minutes continuously. Reading right before bed or upon waking strengthens unfavorable associations, so choose other times. Treat it like exerciseâ€”go for short, regular intervals to build mental endurance over time.
### Discussing What You Read
Sharing discussions about books enhances the experience for many. Connecting with others experiencing similar challenges or interests adds motivation. Social media groups, online forums and book clubs let readers worldwide exchange ideas. Asking family or friends questions keeps you engaged when tiredness hits. Their enthusiasm may inspire continuing despite difficulties on particularly hard passages. 
### Using Context Clues and Dictionary Apps
Occasional unknown words are inevitable but shouldn't stop the flow. Note words to research later, and often surrounding context offers guidance. Dictionary and thesaurus apps allow quick, discreet definitions on the go without disrupting immersion. Looking up 4-5 words maximizes understanding without preventing enjoyment due to constant interruptions. Referring to difficult sections again after clarifying vocabulary boosts comprehension.
### Incorporating Audiobooks and E-Books
Integrating audiobooks with reading printed or digital texts employs multiple learning styles. Listen during commutes or chores while following along in print. Hearing native pronunciation and intonation improves listening skills. E-readers allow adjusting text size, built-in dictionaries and note-taking without printing costs. Mixing formats keeps the experience fresh and engaging during tougher periods. With persistence and variety, reading stamina in English is highly achievable.
