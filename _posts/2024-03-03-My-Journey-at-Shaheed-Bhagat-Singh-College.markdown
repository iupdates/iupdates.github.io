## Getting Admitted ### A Long Day of Waiting
I traveled overnight by train to make it to my top college choice, Shaheed Bhagat Singh College, on the last day of the first admission cutoff. When I arrived around 9am, there was already a long line of eager students waiting outside the campus gates. Over the next five hours, we endured the hot sun as more students continued joining the queue. Finally, around 2pm, the gates opened and the admission process began. 

It was a lengthy procedure with multiple verification steps. By around 9pm, after providing all required documents and going through numerous checks, I was relieved to receive my admission confirmation. It had been a very long day but I was overjoyed to officially start my journey as a Shaheed Bhagat Singh College student.

## Orientation Day ### Learning About College Life 
The following week was orientation day where we had sessions by the Heads of Departments to learn about the various courses offered. The principal addressed us all and laid out the rules and systems in place. We also got to explore the large campus, checking out facilities like the libraries, computer labs, sports grounds and canteen. It was very informative learning all about how college life would unfold over the next few years.

## Regular Classes Begin ### Adjusting to a New Routine  
Classes began in full swing the next week. It was an adjustment getting used to the classroom environments and lecture styles of different professors. The infrastructure like spacious labs and WiFi connectivity impressed me. I was also getting familiar with the daily commute routines and figuring out time management between studies and other activities. 

## Exploring College Societies ### Discovering New Interests
To explore beyond academics, I attended several workshops hosted by various college clubs and societies. There were societies for activities like debating, photography, dance and cultural programs. I interviewed for some and joined the film appreciation and trekking clubs. It was exciting participating in initial activities and meeting new people with similar interests.  

## Favorite Hangout Spot ### A Place to Relax
During my college exploration, I discovered a small Rajasthani cuisine joint near the campus. It quickly became a favorite spot for me and my friends to relax over a hot cup of chai and samosa between classes. The homely ambiance and generous serving sizes won us over. I have continued recommending it to juniors as the best place to refuel on a student budget.

## Campus Life ### Utilizing College Facilities  
Our large college grounds have extensive facilities that made campus life very enjoyable. I love utilizing the open-air basketball courts to play with friends and blow off steam. The peaceful sandhya vatika garden area amidst trees became my favorite spot for getting fresh air and reading. I also appreciated the unique circular architecture of our main college buildings.  

## Bonding with Friends ### Connecting with Peers
Making new friends has been one of the best parts of college. Through classes and shared interests in various societies, I bonded with many like-minded people. The seniors also guided us junior students especially during the initial settling in period. It has been great creating lifelong connections and having support systems through this journey so far.

## Teacher Interactions ### Faculty Going the Extra Mile  
Some of the approachable faculty members always made themselves available for guidance beyond just academics. They showed care for students' overall growth and challenged us to push our limits. I am grateful for professors who took time to understand individuals and offer support. Their dedication reinforced my choice to study at this institution.

## Cherished Memories ### Looking Back with Fondness  
Orientation day remains the most memorable college event for the warm welcome and launch into this phase of life. As my time at Shaheed Bhagat Singh College crosses the halfway mark, I look back fondly on the experiences, learnings and people I've encountered so far. I am truly thankful and excited for more growth during the remaining years at this premier institution.
