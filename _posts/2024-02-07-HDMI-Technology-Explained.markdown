### A Brief History of the HDMI Standard  
HDMI was introduced in late 2002 and became widely adopted in the mid-2000s as flat panel displays proliferated. Early versions supported resolutions up to 1080p and lossless Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1 audio. Subsequent updates added support for higher dynamic range formats, 3D, 4K, higher refresh rates and advanced audio like Dolby Atmos. HDMI is administered by the HDMI Forum, which coordinates innovation while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Understanding HDMI Cables

### Digital vs. Analog Signals and Cable Requirements
Unlike analog connections, digital video/audio transmitted over HDMI cable is either perfect or distorted - there are no levels of quality in between. For reliable transmission, HDMI cables must meet certain specifications to support the device’s maximum resolution and feature set without errors or signal loss. Issues often arise from using low quality "non-certified" cables inadequate for the signal. 

### HDMI Cable Categories and Standards  
HDMI.org defines several cable categories based on features supported. Standard HDMI cables can reliably carry 1080p and 2K signals. High Speed cables are rated for higher resolutions up to 4K/60Hz while Premium Certified cables also support advanced HDR formats and higher refresh rates. Selection depends on the capabilities of specific devices being connected.

### Debunking Cable Pricing Myths   
While cable quality matters, extremely expensive cables beyond the certified specifications provide no real benefit. Digital HDMI signals either arrive intact or contain errors - more expensive materials don’t enhance the picture. Stick with reputable brands within the price range needed by your setup’s highest resolution outputs.

## Connecting Devices with HDMI

### HDMI Port Types: Inputs and Outputs
All HDMI devices have at least one HDMI output to send video/audio to another device. TVs and displays also include multiple HDMI inputs to accept source connections. Sources like set-top boxes or media streamers typically have just one output. Know the port types required for intended connections. 

### Switches, Splitters and Multi-Device Solutions   
HDMI switches allow multiple sources to connect to a single TV input using push-button or CEC automatic source selection. Splitters duplicate the same signal to multiple TVs. Combined switch/splitters provide flexible routing options. Consider powered models for longer runs or 4K/HDR compatibility.

### Connecting Non-HDMI Devices
While HDMI streamlines standards-based connections, older or niche devices may only output analog, component, S-Video or optical/coaxial audio. Use the appropriate conversion cable, box or A/V receiver to continue benefiting from HDMI's conveniences.

## Understanding Video Resolutions and Compatibility

### HDMI Resolution Standards
HDMI supports resolutions from legacy 480i/480p up to the latest 8K standards. Common resolutions include 1080p (Full HD), 2K (1440p), 4K (2160p) and 8K (7680p). Frame rates may vary from 24Hz to 60Hz or higher depending on standards. Ensure devices are within these resolution/frame rate specs.

### Compatibility Between Sources and Displays  
Not all devices support every format. Check manufacturer specs and configure in compatible modes. If handshake fails, try lowering the resolution or frame rate. Updates can add support, so research if a firmware update resolves issues. Additionally, older HDMI cables may not reliably carry newer higher resolution signals requiring an upgrade. 

### Troubleshooting Resolution or Connectivity Problems
Common issues include unclear troubleshooting messages, black screens or no audio. First confirm all cables and ports work independently. Erase supplementary display settings. As a test, try known compatible resolutions, different ports or temporarily disconnect problematic devices.

## Understanding HDMI Audio Formats

### Basic HDMI Audio Transfer Methods
In addition to carrying multi-channel lossless formats, HDMI can output two-channel PCM audio or pass lossy formats like Dolby Digital. Automatic detection passes through the highest quality common format. HDMI also supports LPCM up to 8 channels at 192kHz/24-bit resolution.

### Advanced HDMI Audio Features
Advanced features include Audio Return Channel (ARC) which passes audio back to a television to be sent to connected speakers wirelessly. Newer sets also support enhanced ARC (eARC) for carrying advanced immersive formats. Ensure TV and receiver both support desired formats. 

### Connecting Home Theater Gear
A/V receivers provide flexible audio routing and decoding. Connect Blu-ray players, streaming devices and gaming consoles directly to the receiver using HDMI. The receiver then outputs video to the TV via another HDMI port while distributing audio amongst speakers for optimal surround sound.

## Optimizing Your Home Theater Setup

### Routing Video and Audio Signals
Carefully consider the optimum routing of video and audio signals between all devices for the best user experience. Utilize HDMI features like ARC/eARC, multiple HDMI inputs/outputs and digital optical/coaxial inputs to distribute video and carry surround formats with minimal wiring hassles. 

### Controlling Multiple Devices from One Remote
Convenience features allow controlling audio/video systems using a single remote. CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) enables automatic source switching by adjacent button presses on the TV remote, no extra remotes required. IR/RF universal remotes can also unify system controls.

### Configuring Display and Audio Settings 
Set the TV and A/V receiver to pass audio formats without transcoding for lossless reproduction. Configure advanced display settings to match content like enabling 4:4:4 color, disabling post-processing and setting correct aspect ratios for proper viewing.

## Maintaining and Troubleshooting HDMI

### Common HDMI Problems and Solutions
Issues like no video/audio, flickering, signal dropping or screen abnormalities often stem from defective cables, ports wearing out from repeated plugging/unplugging, interference or simply outdated software/firmware. First inspect connections/cables then try a different port or reset devices. 

### When to Replace Faulty HDMI Ports or Cables
Ports with bent or missing pins may need soldering skills beyond most home users. Consider professional repair or replacing the unit if under warranty. For connections suspected of deterioration, start by swapping the cable before investing in costly repairs. Reputable HDMI cables are affordable insurance against future hassles.

### Warranty and Third-Party Support Options
Thoroughly check warranty coverage as some manufacturers replace faulty HDMI ports for free during the limited warranty period, especially on recent purchases. Extended warranties and accidental damage plans offer multi-year protection. Independent service centers provide out-of-warranty repair estimates before commencing work.
