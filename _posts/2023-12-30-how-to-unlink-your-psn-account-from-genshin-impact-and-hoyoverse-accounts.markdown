### Introduction   
Have you ever wanted to completely separate your PlayStation Network (PSN) account from ***Genshin Impact*** or ***Hoyoverse accounts***? There are a few good reasons why players may want to do this, such as privacy concerns or simply wanting a "fresh start" with new accounts not linked to an old PSN profile. However, just deleting your PSN account is not enough - it does not automatically remove the association from other platforms. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the proper steps to formally **initiate an unlink request** and fully separate your PSN credentials.

### How to Unlink from Genshin Impact
The first thing you need to do is log into your ***Genshin Impact*** account through the official website. Once logged in, locate the "User Center" section and click on the "Account Settings" option. From there, look for the "Link Account" section and you will see your currently linked PSN profile displayed. Click the "Unlink" button next to your PSN credentials. This will send a request to the developers to remove the connection. It typically only takes a day or two to be fully unlinked. 
### How to Unlink from Hoyoverse Accounts  
Since ***Hoyoverse*** oversees multiple games beyond just ***Genshin Impact***, the process is slightly different. You will need to contact customer support directly to initiate the unlinking. The best way is to send an email to the provided Hoyoverse support address. Be sure to include **"PSN Account Unlink Request"** clearly in the subject line. In the body, provide your ***Hoyoverse*** username and the email address associated with the account. A support representative will reply to verify account ownership and guide you through removing the PSN connection.
### Benefits of Properly Unlinking Accounts
While deleting your PSN profile may seem like an easy solution, there are some drawbacks to keep in mind. For one, the deletion process can take upwards of 1-2 months for the account to be fully removed from Sony's systems. During this time, your PSN profile would still be attached to other platforms. Secondly, deleting your account risks permanently losing any **digital games or achievements** purchased through the PSN Store. It is always preferable to formally request an unlink through the proper channels. This ensures a much faster removal typically completed within a week.
### What Happens if You Delete Your PSN Account  
If you go ahead and delete your PSN account before unlinking elsewhere, there are a few potential outcomes:
- Your ***Genshin Impact*** or ***Hoyoverse*** profile would show an error that the linked PSN profile is no longer active
- You may be unable to log into or access certain features of those accounts 
- It could take several weeks or months before the automatic "unlinking" even occurs
- There is no guarantee your accounts will even be fully separated after deletion
- Any friends or contacts added through PSN would no longer be visible
For these reasons, proactively contacting support is strongly recommended over outright deletion if your goal is a full and permanent separation of accounts.
### Initiating an Unlink Request for Hoyoverse Accounts
Now that you understand the implications, here are the specific steps to initiate an unlink request for all ***Hoyoverse*** affiliated games and profiles:
First, send an email to the Hoyoverse customer service address listed on their official website. In the subject line, write **"PSN Account Unlink Request"**. In the body, provide your username, email address registered to your Hoyoverse profile, and the username of your PSN profile you wish to separate. Within 2 business days, you will receive an automated response with further instructions. A support agent will then reply to verify your identity and guide you through removing the connection on their end. The whole process typically takes less than a week once initiated through this official channel.
### Keep Existing Accounts for Future Use  
Rather than deleting your valuable PSN, ***Genshin Impact,*** or ***Hoyoverse*** accounts, consider some alternative options to unlinking safely:
- Make a fresh email address instead of removing existing profiles tied to purchases   
- You can request to change your usernames rather than lose them entirely
- Preserve any digital games, in-app purchases or unique items in your accounts
- Friends and multiplayer progress will stay intact if accounts remain open
- Consider "shelving" accounts for future use rather than outright deleting
By taking the time to properly file unlink requests, you maintain ownership of all your profiles and online identities while also gaining independence from the PSN platform. It is the best of both worlds compared to rashly deleting accounts.
### Summary 
In summary, unlinking your PSN, ***Genshin Impact***, and ***Hoyoverse*** accounts is a straightforward process if done through the official channels rather than account deletion. Contact customer support, provide the necessary verification details, and they will guide you. Preserve your valuable digital content, friends lists and online gaming history by keeping accounts open - just make sure to fully separate the connection to PSN. With a little patience, you can untie these linked platforms safely and responsibly. I hope this guide has helped explain the options available and best practices for unlinking when needed.
