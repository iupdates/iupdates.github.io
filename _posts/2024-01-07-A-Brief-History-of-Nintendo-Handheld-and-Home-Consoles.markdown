### Early Handheld Innovation

Nintendo started as a playing card company in 1889 before venturing into the video game industry in the 1970s. Their first foray was with handheld electronic games as Nintendo saw the future potential. In 1977, they released the Color TV-Game series which were plug-and-play consoles with simple games shown on a television set. These early machines helped pave the way for Nintendo's more refined handhelds to come.

### Game & Watch Leads the Way 

From 1980 to 1991, Nintendo released their immensely popular Game & Watch series of handheld LCD games. Featuring character IP such as Mario and Zelda in simple side-scrolling or puzzle games, over 43 million Game & Watch units were sold worldwide. They proved handheld gaming could be a huge commercial success and demonstrated Nintendo's ability to craft fun gameplay experiences on miniature hardware.

### Reviving the Industry with the NES

In the 1980s, Nintendo entered the home console market with the Famicom and its international version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It helped revive the American video game industry following the 1983 crash. Titles like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda became instant classics and established franchises that remain iconic today. Powered by traditional cartridges, the NES set the standard for home console design and control schemes.

### Handheld King - The Gamboy

Building on the success of its handhelds, Nintendo launched the original monochromatic Game Boy in 1989. Featuring the legendary Tetris, it found a gigantic install base of over 118 million users. Later, the Game Boy Color and Advance models added color screens and more advanced capabilities. Pokemon games also contributed hugely to the Game Boy's popularity. It reigned as the best-selling handheld system for over a decade.

### 16-bit Power of the SNES  

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) succeeded the NES in 1990, introducing 16-bit graphics and processing. Controllers added shoulder buttons and games showcased new depth. Star Fox impressed with its 3D polygonal visuals. Overall the SNES continued Nintendo's momentum and outsold its competitors, the Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16. Its legendary library features memorable titles like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Super Mario World.

### Expanding Dimensions with Nintendo 64 

In 1996, Nintendo launched the Nintendo 64 to compete amidst new 32-bit and CD-ROM based competitors. It introduced 3D gaming and textures to consoles but lacked diversity elsewhere. The controller's digital pad and analog stick aimed to address 3D control problems. While its 3D technology delivered titles such as the acclaimed Super Mario 64, the N64 faced challenges from Sony's emerging PlayStation brand and CD format.

### Dual Screen Ingenuity of the Nintendo DS

Nintendo's hit 2004 DS handheld featured dual displays - the top touch screen enabled new gameplay styles. Over 154 million DS systems have been sold globally, making it the best-selling handheld to date. Games like Nintendogs showed how the DS could create virtual pet experiences. Later DSi models added cameras, download play, and an online store improving portability further. The broad library appealed to all ages.

### Innovating Controls for Everyone with Wii

In 2006, Nintendo rocked the industry again with the Wii home console and Wii Remote controller using motion sensor inputs. Wii Sports introduced "waggle" motions to millions in their living rooms. The hardware design promoted more physical and accessible gameplay for all demographics. Beyond 101 million sales, the Wii holds the record as the bestselling home console of all time and demonstrated gaming as a truly social mainstream activity. 

### Seamless Switching with Switch 

Remaining at the cutting edge, the breakthrough Nintendo Switch launched in 2017. As a home console, handheld, and everything in between, Switch offered unprecedented freedom. Removing traditional boundaries inspired new possibilities. Players experience deep portable joy with signature games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey wherever, whenever with anyone. Its hybrid flexibility continues driving momentum forward for Nintendo.
